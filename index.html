<p>This small web-app was created to aid the support-team at Visit with the everyday tasks that previosly involved SQL-queries in the database.<br>
  The application was set up as an MVC ASP.NET-app with the sole purpose of visualizing SQL-queries. The queries performed included org:[id], product:[id] etc.<br>
  With the resulting pages, the support staff could check distribution channels per organization, what settings that were set behind the scenes, how many products that were bookable and present online (for this, an ajax-call was utilized which returned live-status).<br>
  <br>
  The application has been used a lot, and started as a Hackathon-project. I've also learnt a lot about dictionaries, loops and linq-queries in this process.<br>
